  abstract  = {The task of robotic mobile manipulation poses several scientific
               challenges that need to be addressed to execute complex
               manipulation tasks in unstructured environments, in which
               collaboration with humans might be required. Therefore, we
               present ALMA, a motion planning and control framework for a
               torque-controlled quadrupedal robot equipped with a six degrees
               of freedom robotic arm capable of performing dynamic locomotion
               while executing manipulation tasks. The online motion planning
               framework, together with a whole-body controller based on a
               hierarchical optimization algorithm, enables the system to walk,
               trot and pace while executing operational space end-effector
               control, reactive human-robot collaboration and torso posture
               optimization to increase the arm's workspace. The torque control
               of the whole system enables the implementation of compliant
               behavior, allowing a user to safely interact with the robot.
               We verify our framework on the real robot by performing tasks
               such as opening a door and carrying a payload together with a
               human.},

               driving. The developed optimization framework tightly integrates
               the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the wheels. Our

               forces by solving a sequence of prioritized tasks including the

               on ANYmal, a quadrupedal robot that is fully torque-controlled
               including the non-steerable wheels attached to its legs. We
               conducted experiments on flat and inclined terrains as well as

                  In this letter, we present a whole-body nonlinear model predictive control approach for rigid body systems subject to contacts. We use a full-dynamic system model which also includes explicit contact dynamics. Therefore, contact locations, sequences, and timings are not prespecified but optimized by the solver. Yet, using numerical and software engineering allows for running the nonlinear Optimal Control solver at rates up to 190 Hz on a quadruped for a time horizon of half a second. This outperforms the state-of-the-art by at least one order of magnitude. Hardware experiments in the form of periodic and nonperiodic tasks are applied to two quadrupeds with different actuation systems. The obtained results underline the performance, transferability, and robustness of the approach.

                  This letter presents a realtime motion planning and control method that enables a quadrupedal robot to execute dynamic gaits including trot, pace, and dynamic lateral walk, as well as gaits with full flight phases such as jumping, pronking, and running trot. The proposed method also enables smooth transitions between these gaits. Our approach relies on an online zero-moment point based motion planner which continuously updates the reference motion trajectory as a function of the contact schedule and the state of the robot. The reference footholds for each leg are obtained by solving a separate optimization problem. The resulting optimized motion plans are tracked by a hierarchical whole-body controller. Our framework has been tested in simulation and on ANYmal, a fully torque-controllable quadrupedal robot, both in simulation and on the actual robot.

                  We present a single trajectory optimization formulation for legged locomotion that automatically determines the gait sequence, step timings, footholds, swing-leg motions, and six-dimensional body motion over nonflat terrain, without any additional modules. Our phase-based parameterization of feet motion and forces allows to optimize over the discrete gait sequence using only continuous decision variables. The system is represented using a simplified centroidal dynamics model that is influenced by the feet's location and forces. We explicitly enforce friction cone constraints, depending on the shape of the terrain. The nonlinear programming problem solver generates highly dynamic motion plans with full flight phases for a variety of legged systems with arbitrary morphologies in an efficient manner. We validate the feasibility of the generated plans in simulation and on the real quadruped robot ANYmal. Additionally, the entire solver software TOWR, which used to generate these motions is made freely available.

                    Legged robots pose one of the greatest challenges in robotics. Dynamic and agile maneuvers of animals cannot be imitated by existing methods that are crafted by humans. A compelling alternative is reinforcement learning, which requires minimal craftsmanship and promotes the natural evolution of a control policy. However, so far, reinforcement learning research for legged robots is mainly limited to simulation, and only few and comparably simple examples have been deployed on real systems. The primary reason is that training with real robots, particularly with dynamically balancing systems, is complicated and expensive. In the present work, we introduce a method for training a neural network policy in simulation and transferring it to a state-of-the-art legged system, thereby leveraging fast, automated, and cost-effective data generation schemes. The approach is applied to the ANYmal robot, a sophisticated medium-dog{\textendash}sized quadrupedal system. Using policies trained in simulation, the quadrupedal machine achieves locomotion skills that go beyond what had been achieved with prior methods: ANYmal is capable of precisely and energy-efficiently following high-level body velocity commands, running faster than before, and recovering from falling even in complex configurations.
