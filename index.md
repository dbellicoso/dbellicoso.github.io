I am Dario Bellicoso, a robotics researcher at the <a href="http://www.rsl.ethz.ch">Robotic Systems Lab</a> of <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zurich</a> focusing on motion control and planning for multi-limb walking robots. During my Ph.D., I have developed algorithms that allow a torque-controlled quadrupedal robot walk, run, jump, and open doors.

We present a motion planning and control framework for ANYmal, a torque-controlled quadrupedal robot equipped with a six degrees of freedom robotic arm capable of performing dynamic locomotion while executing manipulation tasks. The online motion planning framework, together with a whole-body control based on a hierarchical optimization algorithm, enable the system to walk, trot and pace while executing tasks such as fixed-position end-effector control, reactive human-robot collaboration and torso posture optimization to increase the armâ€™s kinematic reachability. The torque controllability of the whole system enables the implementation of compliant behaviour, allowing a user to safely interact with the robot in a very natural way. We verify our framework on the real robot by performing tasks such as opening a door or carrying a payload together with a human.
