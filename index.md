Hi! I am Dario, a Senior Staff Research Scientist at <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/">Boston Dynamics</a>, where I develop algorithms for motion planning, control, and reinforcement learning. I received my Ph.D. from the <a href="http://www.rsl.ethz.ch">Robotic Systems Lab</a> of <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zurich</a> focusing on motion control and planning for multi-limbed walking robots. During my research, I developed algorithms that allow <a href="https://youtu.be/m1-s8iOJaI4">ANYmal</a>, a torque-controlled quadrupedal robot, to walk, run, jump, and open doors.

We present a motion planning and control framework for ANYmal, a torque-controlled quadrupedal robot equipped with a six degrees of freedom robotic arm capable of performing dynamic locomotion while executing manipulation tasks. The online motion planning framework, together with a whole-body control based on a hierarchical optimization algorithm, enable the system to walk, trot and pace while executing tasks such as fixed-position end-effector control, reactive human-robot collaboration and torso posture optimization to increase the arm’s kinematic reachability. The torque controllability of the whole system enables the implementation of compliant behaviour, allowing a user to safely interact with the robot in a very natural way. We verify our framework on the real robot by performing tasks such as opening a door or carrying a payload together with a human.
