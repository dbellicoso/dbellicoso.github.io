  abstract  = {The task of robotic mobile manipulation poses several scientific
               challenges that need to be addressed to execute complex
               manipulation tasks in unstructured environments, in which
               collaboration with humans might be required. Therefore, we
               present ALMA, a motion planning and control framework for a
               torque-controlled quadrupedal robot equipped with a six degrees
               of freedom robotic arm capable of performing dynamic locomotion
               while executing manipulation tasks. The online motion planning
               framework, together with a whole-body controller based on a
               hierarchical optimization algorithm, enables the system to walk,
               trot and pace while executing operational space end-effector
               control, reactive human-robot collaboration and torso posture
               optimization to increase the arm's workspace. The torque control
               of the whole system enables the implementation of compliant
               behavior, allowing a user to safely interact with the robot.
               We verify our framework on the real robot by performing tasks
               such as opening a door and carrying a payload together with a
               human.},

  abstract  = {We show dynamic locomotion strategies for wheeled quadrupedal
               robots, which combine the advantages of both walking and
               driving. The developed optimization framework tightly integrates
               the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the wheels. Our
               approach relies on a zero-moment point based motion optimization
               which continuously updates reference trajectories. The reference
               motions are tracked by a hierarchical whole-body controller
               which computes optimal generalized accelerations and contact
               forces by solving a sequence of prioritized tasks including the
               nonholonomic rolling constraints. Our approach has been tested 
               on ANYmal, a quadrupedal robot that is fully torque-controlled
               including the non-steerable wheels attached to its legs. We
               conducted experiments on flat and inclined terrains as well as
               over steps, whereby we show that integrating the wheels into the
               motion control and planning framework results in intuitive
               motion trajectories, which enable more robust and dynamic
               locomotion compared to other wheeled-legged robots. Moreover,
               with a speed of 4 m/s and a reduction of the cost of transport
               by 83 % we prove the superiority of wheeled-legged robots
               compared to their legged counterparts.},
